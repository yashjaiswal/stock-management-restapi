### Following actions are planned for this rest api.

1. Adding `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE` request URLs for updating the entity rows. Currently, the support is only for reading the data using  `GET`.</br>

2. Creating a sample front page JSP allowing the user to perform all actions with click of the button and to see the data live being updated on the browser in a seperate pane.</br>

3. Adding some more `GET` methods for use-cases like getting total brand-value of a particular brand, total pending amount to be paid to a distributor for a bill procured.

4. This project may be further expanded to include graphs, and visual representation of the data to help analyze the total sales of a brand. I am aiming to do this usinf d3.js
